# BRIK L3 Certification Guide

## Overview

BRIK L3 Certification ensures your project meets enterprise-grade standards for:
- **Structure Compliance**: Proper BRIK architecture (CORE, WRAPPERS, LIVING_LAYER)
- **Security Excellence**: No vulnerabilities, secrets, or security anti-patterns
- **Cross-Language Support**: Multi-language compilation and compatibility
- **Dependency Management**: Secure and up-to-date dependencies
- **Project Integrity**: Cryptographic hash verification

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run complete L3 certification
npm run l3:certify

# Run individual components
npm run l3:structure        # Structure validation
npm run l3:security         # Security audit
npm run l3:cross-lang       # Cross-language tests
npm run l3:hash             # Generate project hash
npm run l3:hash:verify      # Verify existing hash
```

## Certification Levels

| Level | Score | Requirements |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **L4** | 95-100% | Perfect compliance + advanced features |
| **L3** | 85-94% | Enterprise-ready with minor improvements |
| **L2** | 70-84% | Good foundation, needs refinement |
| **L1** | 50-69% | Basic compliance, significant work needed |
| **L0** | 0-49% | Does not meet minimum standards |

## L3 Requirements (≥85% score)

### Structure Validation (30% weight)
- ✅ All CORE components present (BrikCore, BrikControlHub, etc.)
- ✅ Essential WRAPPER components (≥50% of recommended)
- ✅ LIVING_LAYER components with LLM integration
- ✅ Required documentation files

### Security Audit (25% weight)
- ✅ No exposed secrets or credentials
- ✅ No critical/high security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Secure configuration patterns
- ✅ Safe file permissions

### Cross-Language Compilation (20% weight)
- ✅ TypeScript/JavaScript compilation success
- ✅ Multi-language project support
- ✅ Configuration file compatibility
- ✅ Cross-platform reproducibility

### Hash Generation (15% weight)
- ✅ Reproducible cryptographic hash
- ✅ Project integrity verification
- ✅ Secure hash algorithm (SHA-256+)

### Dependency Analysis (10% weight)
- ✅ No high/critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ Up-to-date dependencies
- ✅ Clean dependency tree

## Automated Certification

The project includes GitHub Actions workflow that automatically:
- Runs L3 certification on every PR
- Generates detailed reports
- Comments results on pull requests
- Uploads certification artifacts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Structure validation failing:**
- Implement missing BRIK components
- Follow BRIK Core Framework architecture
- Add required documentation files

**Security audit failing:**
- Remove `.env` files and secrets from repository
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Fix security anti-patterns in code

**Cross-language tests failing:**
- Ensure TypeScript compilation works
- Fix package.json/tsconfig.json issues
- Test with `npm run build` or `tsc --noEmit`

**Hash generation failing:**
- Check file permissions
- Ensure Node.js is available
- Verify project structure integrity

## Manual Verification

```bash
# Verify project structure
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" | head -10

# Check for secrets (should return nothing)
grep -r "api_key\|secret\|password" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . || echo "✅ No secrets found"

# Verify dependencies
npm audit --audit-level high

# Test compilation
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Support

For L3 certification support:
1. Review generated reports in detail
2. Follow recommendations in priority order
3. Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed errors
4. Ensure all required tools are available
